I'm just now learning how to use GitHub!

I'm Randelle, and I am an aspiring Dev. I'm learning to code for several reasons. First and foremost, I believe that the way that society is headed, coding will be an important skill for everyone to learn in order to navigate the world: whether you plan to work as a programmer or not. Secondly though, I'd love to make some money at it, some day. I aspire to increase my skillset so that all my eggs are not in one basket. I am trying to diversify my skills and my income streams. I believe a job in programming can offer me the flexibiity I desire in the future.
